# B.Sc. Thesis

Repository for the coding part of my Bachelor Thesis written in Summer Term 2020(if Covid-19 lets me).

## Subject

The Thesis focuses pattern approaches to classify graphs. To do this we search for patterns inside large DataSets of Graphs.
To search for these patterns we define pattern languages.

The goal is to compare these pattern languages using criteria listed below.

## Explanation

The program can:

* Read benchmark Graphs with the below described format
* Mine patterns using our pattern languages
* Use these Patterns to train a SVM
* Use this SVM to classify Graphs
* Help us collect data using the following criteria

## Criteria

## Graph format
